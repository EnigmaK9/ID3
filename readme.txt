CIS 472 Assignment 1

Execution:
python id3.py </trainData.csv> </testData.csv> </MFN> 

trainData - csv file contating training data
testData - csv file contatining test data
MFN - model file name (all one word ex: XORmodel)

The file you specify will hold the decision tree generated by id3

I did all the logical gates with two inputs (and, xor, nor.. etc)
What I noticed is that every one of these dual gates is a unique desicion tree from the training data.
AND for example
0 1 0
1 0 0
1 1 1
0 0 0
Thus knowing
0 1 0
1 0 0
0 0 0
I can know that the final case even though unseen could be correctly identified - This was stupid; and my naive attempt at unsupervised learning
There are two inputs thus 4 combinations of a binary output
I could teach the tree to account for knowing a flush of the positive answers from some dual gate.
I began to thread logic into my code to count for Class 1 being known twice across these simple gates.
Soon I was getting the tree to correctly do simple XOR by knowing 3 of the 4 cases.
This was pointless, I should have focused on my chi-square test; my accuracy is extremely low on the test data.
Sorry, next assignment I'll do better
